# What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?

string = "Welcome to America!"
a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]

#is this a trick question? err?
# otherwise.... a = "e"?
# b = "A"
# c = nil

#lets check...

puts a 
puts b 
puts c 

#hey I was right!
#so strings are kind of like Arrays? You can access parts of them by an index?
#does that mean i can use .first and .last on them?

puts string.first

#...nope HAHA
