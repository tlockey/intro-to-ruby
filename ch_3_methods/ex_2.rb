=end

# 1. 
x = 2
# my guess returns => 2
# guess = correct

# 2. 
puts x = 2
# my guess returns => nil
# puts => 2
# guess = correct

# 3.
p name = "Joe"
# my guess returns => nil
# prints => name = "Joe"
# guess = wrong
# Ohhh, that's very interesting. P does not return nil. It returns the string.
# It also prints the string.

# 4. 
four = "four"
# my guess => "four"
# guess = correct

# 5. 
print something = "nothing"
# my guess => nil
# prints => nothing
# guess = correct. It prints nothing without the trailing newline character.
